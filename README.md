# Hi-lo-Piccolo
Site for Hi-lo Piccolo - makers of fun stuff
My sister, Tessa, would like this site to reflect our combined sense of style. I don't want it to look like a website, I would like it to look like it's been cobbled together from bits and pieces - cardboard, buttons, stickytape - you know the kind of thing.
