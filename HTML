  Hi. We are <strong>Hi-lo Piccolo</strong>. We are two mums, makers (and sisters) from </br> 
  sun-drenched Eastbourne, on the south coast of England. We can make </br> 
  all sorts of things; including props, installations and presents, but mostly</br> 
  we run creative workshops and make content for kid's books and</br> 
  magazines. We can also make music (well, one of us can) and juggle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
   <strong>WE LOVE CARDBOARD, LIKE REALLY LOVE IT!</strong><br/>
   <br/>
   Nothing makes us happier than sharing our passion for <strong>snipping, </br> painting, sticking and playing</strong> with the world. Why not check out our </br> latest projects to get a better feel for what we do.
